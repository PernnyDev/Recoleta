## Implementation approach
We will use the Flask framework for building the web application due to its simplicity and flexibility. For the database, we will use SQLAlchemy which is a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. For user authentication, we will use Flask-Login. For real-time communication, we will use Flask-SocketIO. For form validation and submission, we will use Flask-WTF. For notifications, we will use Flask-Mail.

## Python package name
```python
"recycle_marketplace"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "views.py",
    "static/css/main.css",
    "templates/index.html",
    "templates/login.html",
    "templates/register.html",
    "templates/listing.html",
    "templates/search.html",
    "templates/chat.html"

```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User{
        +str username
        +str email
        +str password_hash
        +list[Item] items
        +list[Review] reviews
        +__init__(username: str, email: str, password: str)
        +check_password(password: str): bool
    }
    class Item{
        +str title
        +str description
        +float price
        +User owner
        +__init__(title: str, description: str, price: float, owner: User)
    }
    class Review{
        +User reviewer
        +User reviewed
        +str content
        +int rating
        +__init__(reviewer: User, reviewed: User, content: str, rating: int)
    }
    User "1" -- "*" Item: owns
    User "1" -- "*" Review: writes
    User "1" -- "*" Review: receives
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant U as User
    participant I as Item
    participant R as Review
    M->>U: register(username, email, password)
    M->>U: login(username, password)
    U->>I: list_item(title, description, price)
    M->>I: search_item(title)
    M->>U: initiate_chat(user, item)
    M->>R: write_review(reviewer, reviewed, content, rating)
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
